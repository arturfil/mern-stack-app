# mern-stack-app

This is an application where I use the MERN stack.

The features of this application will be the following:

You will be able to sign-up and create an account, able to add you programming skills, education and work experience.

Including the fact that you can build your profile, you are able to see other peoples profile and comment amongst each other.

Hence the dev-connector.
